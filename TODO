  - i386: figure out if we can do correct function pointer comparisons 
    across shared object boundaries. ex: function defined in shared library,
    pointer taken in executable, given to shared library, comparison must be
    equal. The issue here is the relationship between the shared library
    PLTs/GOT and main executable PLT/GOT.

  - make sure we use the minimum permissions for ro code sections: some of these
    sections might not need EXEC protection

  - make sure machine_install_trampoline works 

  - PT_INTERP will be invalid when main exec is loader itself

  - dlopen: must be careful to re-open already-opened files

  - get rid of calls everywhere to vdl_file_get_dynamic. Cache the result in VdlFile
