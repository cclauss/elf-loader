      VDL: Virtualizing Dynamic Linker/Loader
      ---------------------------------------

1) What is this ?
-----------------

This is an ELF dynamic linker/loader. Its purpose is
to be a binary-compatible replacement of /lib/ld-linux.so.2
on a large variety of linux distributions for i386/x86-64
systems. Support for other hardware platforms is not planned
but non-intrusive patches are welcome :)

2) What is its purpose ?
------------------------

I need more features from the dynamic loader than what is
provided by the default glibc loader. I could have tried to
hack the glibc loader but since I did not know enough about
the details of how a loader work, and given the horrid 
complexity/lack of documentation of the glibc loader, it 
seemed easier to implement a new loader with the features I
needed.

3) What is its status ?
-----------------------

Right now, this loader can load and run a variety of simple
non-multithreaded command-line programs which make no use of 
dlopen/dclose. ls and cp have been tested.

4) What is the TODO ?
---------------------

The current roadmap calls for the implementation of:
  - libdl.so (dlopen/dlclose/etc.)
  - multithreaded support (including TLS)
  - port to x86-64
  - addition of the new features I need
  - fix gdb support to debug programs not loaded with PT_INTERP
